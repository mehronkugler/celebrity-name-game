## Celebrity Name Game

Created April, 2015

A small app which lets visitors score points by browsing movies and matching actors' names to faces.

This app uses Enceladus to access The Movie Database (TMDB) and jQuery on top of Ruby on Rails.

Working model is located here: https://fierce-tundra-2003.herokuapp.com/

### Current bugs

* When a movie title is sent that returns no result, that error is not handled and the loader continues to spin
